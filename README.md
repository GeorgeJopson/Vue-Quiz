# quiz

This project was made following along with the https://youtu.be/4deVCNJq3qc youtube Vue tutorial.
You can find the code here https://github.com/gwenf/vue-quiz .
However this project differs from the original project as all the CSS is custom made (not using bootstrap-vue) and the quiz endlessly loads questions for the user to answer (instead of just stopping at 10).
